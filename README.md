## Gameplay Mechanics

- **Random generation** of the asteroid field and power-ups for endless variety.

- **Level progression**: Every 100 asteroids survived increases speed and field density.
- **Highscore tracking** stored in persistent `ConfigurationValue`.
- **Shield system** Increase your shield up to 10 impacts using power ups. Displayed in a bar below the player.

## Visuals & Feedback

- **Background Flashes** Atmospheric background effects, colored consistently to indcate game events.
- **Parallax effect** with slower, non-colliding larger asteroids for added depth.
- **Particle effects** for scoring asteroids enhance the action. Particles grow larger and turn pink the higher their value.
- **Hit feedback**: Player opacity blinks when hit, signaling a 2-second invincibility grace period.
- **Haptic feedback**: Vibration and animated effects for damage and level advancement.
- **Combo meter**: A green indicator runs down to show the 2 second combo period.
- **Visualization of combo area**: Helps precisely aimed dodges.
- **Dynamic Progress Bars** for all power-ups to indicate their duration

## Power-Ups

## UI & Controls

## Tactical gameplay considerations

- Chain combos by dodging asteroids within 2 seconds‚Äîprecision pays off with massive score boosts!
- Pickung up any power-up potions resets the combo period and thus count. If you are out for maximum combos, be mindful with collecting power-ups.
- Destroying asteroids before they pass the player either by shooting them individually or using the laserSwipe, removes them from the level progression count. You can push back the level change and thus speed and asteroid density progression by destryoing asteroids.
